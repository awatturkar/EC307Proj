# EC327FinalProject
ROBIN:

This project was born out of the idea of maximizing efficiency and simplicity when it comes to the everyday student's life. As students report the highest anxiety and stress rates out of any group, it is important that we acknowledge the need for new technologies to ease this stress. Robin, your best friend and side kick, because, obviously, you are Batman(TM), does whatever it can to make your life at school just a little bit easier. Opening the app leads to the main page, where you can find your coming assignments within the next three days, the current weather in your zipcode, the ability to add recurring homework, add a due date for project, lab, exam, or homework, as well as add a course or plan study time. After pressing the "Add Course" button, you will find a page that outlines the start and end dates of your class, allows you to enter your lecture and discussion times, as well as the multiplier (the level of importance) for this specific class. After adding the class, all the lectures and discussion sections are automatically scheduled into your calendar. Going back to the main page, you can press the homework button to add recurring assignments that will be automatically placed into your schedule for each week. The "Add Due Date" button allows you to schedule a one-time assignment, enter its due date, which will be treated according to the multiplier applied to that class. The “Add Study Time” button allows you to carve out a chunk of time each week in which you know you will be able to study, and then prioritizes classes with higher multipliers as well as closer due dates.
