Explanation of how the app works: 
Opening the app leads to the main page, where you can find your coming assignments within the next three days, the current weather in your zipcode, as well as the ability to add recurring homework, add a due date for project, lab, exam, or homework, as well as add a course. After pressing the "Add Course" button, you will find a page that outlines the start and end dates of your class, allows you to enter your lecture and discussion times, as well as the multiplier (the level of importance) for this specific class. After adding the class, all the lectures and discussion sections are automatically scheduled into your calendar. Going back to the main page, you can press the homework button to add recurring assignments that will be automatically placed into your schedule for each week. The "add due date" button allows you to schedule a one-time assignment, enter its due date, which will be treated according to the multiplier applied to that class.
